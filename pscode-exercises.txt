// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

int X
int a
int b

a % b = x
if x == 1
	Print "number is Odd"

if x == 0
	Print "number is Even"
	
else
	Print "Invalid input detected"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

int num1
int num2
int num3
int num4
int num5
int avg
int numbers[]
int largest
int smallest

Print "enter number 1"
input() = num1

Print "enter number 2"
input() = num2

Print "enter number 3"
input() = num3

Print "enter number 4"
input() = num4

Print "enter number 5"
input() = num5

(int1 + int2 + int3 + int4 + int5)/5 = avg

num1, num2, num3, num4, num5 ADD numbers

for number in numbers
	if numbers[i] > largest
            largest = numbers[i]
			
	end if numbers[i] < smallest
            smallest = numbers[i]
			
Print "the average is (avg)"
Print "The largest number is (largest) and the smallest is (smallest)"
